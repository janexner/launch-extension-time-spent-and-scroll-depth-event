# Launch Extension "Time Spent and Scroll Depth Event"

Extension for Launch, by Adobe - Adds an Event that triggers after combination of time spent on page and scroll depth reached

Inspired by [Simo Ahava](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/fire-tag-upon-scroll-depth-and-time-spent/), this Extension allows you to build Rules in Launch that fire if a visitor scrolls down a page and stays for some minimal amount of time.

Specifically, the visitor has to both stay on the page, and scroll, for the Event to trigger.
