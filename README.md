# Launch Extension "Content Consumption Events"

Extension for Launch, by Adobe - Provides an Event for measuring the consumption of content.

Inspired by [Simo Ahava](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/fire-tag-upon-scroll-depth-and-time-spent/), this Extension allows you to build Rules in Launch that fire based on a minimal amount of time spent and a minimum of scolling, combined.

The Event will only fire once *both* conditions are met.
